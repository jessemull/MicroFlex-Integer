## MicroFlex

Microplate assays produce semi-structured data in a variety of formats. Due to recent advances in high throughput biology, data from a single experiment can exceed billions or even trillions of data points. Combining, normalizing and analyzing this data requires a significant investment in time, money and resources.  

Introducing MicroFlex, the world's first microplate library designed for bioscience data processing and software development. MicroFlex saves you time and money by simplifying code and eliminating errors in data handling.
